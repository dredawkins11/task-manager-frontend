# Task Manager Web Application

This is a simple project that I've created to learn from. It's just a simple app that lets you add, delete, edit, or search through your own created tasks, sort of like a to-do list.
The frontend is built on Vue and the backend is an express API with a MongoDB connection. A link to the app can be found [here](http://task-manager-project-frontend.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/), and a link the backend repository [here](https://github.com/dredawkins11/task-manager-backend).
